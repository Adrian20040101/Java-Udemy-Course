- the Supplier interface takes no arguments, but returns an instance of some type, T.

- interface name + method signature:
  Supplier         T get()

- we can think of it as kind of like a factory method, since it produces an instance of some object

- however, this doesn't have to be a new or distinct result returned

- here is an use case example : () -> random.nextInt(1, 100)
  we can see that this methid takes no arguements, but lambda expressions can use final or effectively final variables in their expressions.
  The variable is an example of a variable from the enclosing code
