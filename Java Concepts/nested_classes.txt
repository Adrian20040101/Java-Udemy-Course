- there are four types of nested classes:
  - static nested class -> declared in class body. Much like a static field, access to this class is through the Class name identifier
  - instance or inner class -> declared in class body and can only be accessed through an instance of the outer class
  - local class -> declared within a method body
  - anonymous class -> unnamed class, declared and instantiated in the same statement

- before JDK16, only static nested classes were allowed to have static methods, but as of JDK16, all four types of nested classes can have 
  static members of any type, including static methods
