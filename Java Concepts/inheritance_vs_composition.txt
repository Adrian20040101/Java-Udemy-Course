inheritance describes an IS A relationship, whereas composition describes a HAS A relationship.

inheritance is a way to reuse functionality and attributes, whereas composition is a way to make combination of classes act like a single
coherent object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

that siad, composition is preffered over inheritance in many designs, because:
  
  - it is more flexible. You can add or remove parts, which result in less likelyhood of having a downstream effect
  - it provides functional reuse outside of the class hierarchy
  - Java's inheritance breaks encapsulation, because subclasses may need direct access to a parent's state or behaviour
