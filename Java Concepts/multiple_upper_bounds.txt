- text copied from the explanation provided in the java file located at Generics/GenericsExtra/QueryList.java and explains how to use
  multiple bounds and when we should use it

//we can use multiple upper bounds to be more restrictive, with the use of the ampersand operator '&'
//the conditions require a type argument to implement all interfaces declared and be a subtype of any class specified
//it is possible to extend only one class at most, and zero or many interfaces
//we use extends either for a class or an interface or both
//if we do extend a class as well, it is important to type it first, and only after that the interfaces, otherwise we'll get a compiler error
