- when creating a linked list, there are several methods that are used to add or remove elements, depending on the type of operation 

   - Queue/Deque:
      - add methods: offer(), offerFirst(), offerLast()
      - remove methods: poll(), pollFirst(), pollLast()
      - Note! Since the the operations described here also work on double ended queues, also named deques, we also include that type here

   - Stack:
      - add method: push()
      - remove method: pop()

- the specified methods are specific for the queue, deque and stack data types. There are methods specifically used for working with a list,
  for example:
  
   - add methods: add(), add(index, element), addFirst(), addLast()
   - remove methods: remove(index), remove(element), removeFirst(), removeLast() 

- Note! For the queue, deque and stack data types, the add/remove and addFirst/removeFirst, considernig their respective names, achieve the
  same result. The variant that explicitly states "First" after the operation may be less confusing for some users
